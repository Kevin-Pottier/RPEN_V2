# RPEN V2 ‚Äì Next-Gen Connected Pen üñäÔ∏è‚ö°

RPEN V2 (Remote Pen & Air Pen) is the upgraded version of the initial DEEP project developed at ESEO.  
This new version uses a more powerful microcontroller and high-performance components to provide smoother, faster, and more precise remote writing.  

## Planned Features

- **Remote Writing:** Improved motion sensing with next-gen IMU for higher precision.
- **Interactive Modes:** Writing, calibration, and erase with better responsiveness.
- **Customization:** Enhanced size/color management and smoother drawing.
- **User Feedback:** Smarter RGB/haptic feedback for real-time interaction.
- **Wireless Communication:** More stable and low-latency than the previous version.

## Technical Overview

- **Hardware:**  
  - Stronger microcontroller (exact model TBD).  
  - More advanced motion sensor (successor to MPU6050).  
  - Improved feedback system (RGB LEDs, haptics).  
  - TFT screen with optimized interface.  

- **Software:**  
  - Optimized Bluetooth (or alternative) data transmission.  
  - Better noise filtering and frame processing.  
  - Improved algorithms for smoother pen-to-screen interaction.  

## Roadmap

- [ ] Select final microcontroller and components.  
- [ ] Prototype transmitter & receiver.  
- [ ] Implement improved wireless protocol.  
- [ ] Optimize feedback and user experience.
